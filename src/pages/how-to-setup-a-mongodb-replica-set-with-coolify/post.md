This guide will walk you through the process of creating a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) replica set using [Coolify](https://coolify.io), an open-source, self-hostable platform alternative to Heroku / Netlify / Vercel. Coolify simplifies the deployment and management of applications, offering features such as deployment automation, resource management, reverse proxy setup, and automated SSL certificate handling.

## What is a Replica Set?

A MongoDB replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain identical data sets. This configuration provides high availability, data redundancy, and improved read scalability. In a replica set, one node acts as the primary, handling all write operations, while secondary nodes replicate the primary's data.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of MongoDB and Linux commands
- A VPS or a dedicated server
- SSH access to the server

## How to Setup the Replica Set

First, create or obtain a VPS, set up the keys, and SSH into it. If you're unsure how to do this, read my article [How to Configure Your VPS with Security in Mind](https://www.antoniogioia.com/how-to-configure-your-vps-with-security).

### Install Coolify

You can deploy Coolify on your server with a single command, as explained in their [official documentation](https://coolify.io/self-hosted):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

Run it as root. If you created a user (which you should) and SSH'd into the server with it, use:

```bash
sudo su
```

Then run the install command.

At the end of the installation process, you'll get the address where Coolify is running. Assuming our server IP is `123.123.123.123`, the URL will look like:

`http://123.123.123.123:8000` (remember to enable TCP port 8000 on your firewall).

Open the URL in your browser, go through the onboarding process (create an admin account, choose `Localhost` as the instance), and you'll reach the Coolify web interface.

If you own a domain and want to get rid of the `:8000` in the URL and use `https` instead of `http`, you can point a subdomain to this server. Go to your domain provider and add an `A` record to your DNS records:

![DNS records](https://antoniogioia.com/images/blog/coolify-step-0-b.png)

This will point `cluster.mydomain.com` to our server IP. Let's set up Coolify to handle this record. Go to `Settings` and edit as shown in the following image:

![Coolify settings](https://antoniogioia.com/images/blog/coolify-step-0-a.png)

In the `Advanced` options, I disabled `API` and `Auto Update`, and enabled `Do not Track`. Set up your instance as needed for your project.

Save the settings and wait a few minutes for DNS propagation. You should now be able to access Coolify by going to `https://cluster.mydomain.com`. If you get SSL errors, try restarting the Proxy Server in `Servers / localhost`.

When your domain is successfully enabled, remember to disable port 8000 on your firewall.

We can now build our MongoDB replica set.

### Create Database Instances

Click on `Projects` on the left. You should see a button labeled "My first project". Click on `Settings` next to it and set a name for the project; I'll call it `Cluster`.

Click on `Cluster`, choose an environment such as `Production`, and click on `+ New` to add a new Resource.

For a replica set, we need to create at least 3 MongoDB database instances.

To create a database instance, after clicking on `+ New`, select MongoDB from the list:

![Coolify MongoDB](https://antoniogioia.com/images/blog/coolify-step-1-a.png)

Configure the database, setting a name like `repl-1`:

![Coolify MongoDB configuration](https://antoniogioia.com/images/blog/coolify-step-1-b.png)

In the proxy section, set a public port (for example `5432`) and make it publicly available:

![Coolify MongoDB proxy](https://antoniogioia.com/images/blog/coolify-step-1-d.png)

Pick a different port for each database, for example: `5432`, `5433`, and `5434`. Remember to enable these ports on the firewall.

Repeat this step two more times. You'll end up with 3 databases:

### Prepare the Key

SSH into your server and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir replica
cd replica
openssl rand -base64 756 > replica.key
chmod 400 replica.key
sudo chown 999:999 replica.key
```

Assuming the user you created on the server is called `myusername`, this creates a directory for the replica set in `/home/myusername/replica`, generates a key file, and sets the appropriate permissions.

This key will be passed to each database container by adding storage to our instances and applying a custom configuration to each database, as shown in the following steps.

### Add Custom Configuration to Databases

On each database's configuration page, copy and paste the following custom configuration in the `Custom MongoDB Configuration` text area:

```yaml
replication:
  replSetName: "rs0"
security:
  authorization: enabled
  keyFile: /tmp/mongodb/replica.key
```

Remember to click on `Save` every time you change a configuration. This configuration enables replication, sets the replica set name, and specifies the key file for secure communication between members.

### Configure Instance Storage

For each database, on the configuration page, go to `Storages`, click on `+ Add` to add a volume with the following specifications:

- Volume name: `keyfile`
- Source path: `/home/myusername/replica`
- Destination path: `/tmp/mongodb`

![Coolify MongoDB storages](https://antoniogioia.com/images/blog/coolify-step-2-a.png)

This step ensures that the key file is accessible to all instances when started.

You can now start each database by clicking the `Start` button on the configuration page.

### Initialize the Replica Set

Connect to the first database instance (in our case `repl-1`). You can find the connection string on the database configuration page. Use the terminal with mongosh or a GUI like Compass, connect to the database, and run the following command:

```javascript
rs.initiate({
  _id: "rs0",
  members: [
    { _id: 0, host: "<ip>:5432" },
    { _id: 1, host: "<ip>:5433" },
    { _id: 2, host: "<ip>:5434" },
  ],
});
```

Replace `<ip>` with the actual IP addresses of your instances (in our example, it's `123.123.123.123`). This command initializes the replica set with the three members.

### Connect to the Replica Set

In Compass or your application, use the following connection string to connect to your MongoDB replica set:

```
mongodb://<username>:<password>@<ip>:5432,<ip>:5433,<ip>:5434/?replicaSet=rs0
```

Use the `<username>` and `<password>` from the connection string of the primary database (in our case `repl-1`), and replace `<ip>` with the server IP address.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up a basic configuration of a MongoDB replica set using Coolify. This configuration provides better data availability and fault tolerance for your application and can be improved with additional configurations depending on your needs. Remember to monitor your replica set and perform regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance.
